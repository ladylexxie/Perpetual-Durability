### Dependencies
- This mod has no dependencies
- It has compatibility with JEI, where it shows how to apply the Unbreakable tag on any item

### Configuring The Mod
This mod creates two config files in the `/config/` folder\
Their functionality is detailed in the wiki\
To change the item that will apply the Unbreakable effect, you need to remove/add the `perpetual_durability:perpetual` tag to any item(s)\
By default, the tag is added to `minecraft:nether_star`
